In this project, I gained proficiency in utilizing Python's conditionals and loops. I applied various statements, including `if`, `if ... else`, `break`, `continue`, `pass`, and `range`, within both while and for loops.
I also perfected printing strigs using `f"{}"`Furthermore, I honed my Python skills by crafting my own functions and delving into concepts like variable scope, tracebacks, and arithmetic operators.This is such an enticing experience!
